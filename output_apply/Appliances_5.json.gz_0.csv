"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0014CN8Y8","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0014CN8Y8","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0014CN8Y8","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0014CN8Y8","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0014CN8Y8","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0014CN8Y8","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0014CN8Y8","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0014CN8Y8","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0014CN8Y8","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out.

Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out.

Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.

However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out.

Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.

However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out.

Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"

Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"

Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old: reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol. This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","2.0","I got a warehouse deal ""LIKE NEW"" and when I installed it, the coil got hot with the timer switch ""on"" but the dryer wasn't running. So in other words, I turned on the dryer to time dry 30 mins, but didn't start the tumbler yet. When I went back in the laundry room about 30 minutes later, it was incredibly hot in there, so I felt the dryer and it was very hot to the touch. I shut it off, unplugged and proceeded to see what the problem was. I changed the thermostat timer and still did the same. I found a youtube video where the guy says the heater element is grounded out and will stay on. Upon very close inspection to the element (after it cooled off), I notice one of the ceramic pieces that hold a coil was broken off and the coil was touching the casing. I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in. It worked! Well, I'm not taking any chances with this thing getting hot like it did the coil slips off the broken holder and grounds out again. This unit is going back, and I guess I know why it was in the ""used"" bin. I don't blame the manufacturer, it's just a broken unit that got re-sold. The next unit I will test BEFORE I install it. That would have saved me from a lot of trouble and potential damage from the heater coil being stuck on.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide: 1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work. 2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it. 3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten. 4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed. 5. Read #4 again. 6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc. 7. Marvel at how much lint came out. 8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here. 9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint. Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!","CG","OR","True","A8WEXFRWX1ZHH","B0006GVNOA","A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here."
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer. I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY. So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward. I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind. I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them. I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out. I got a good amount of lint clods out. Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out. I got no air coming out at all. My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run. I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment. Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape. I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up). Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens. Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds. I've attached pictures of it. I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you. As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent. A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.","CG","OR","True","A2LDP3A4IE9T6T","B0006GVNOA","This really worked well even taking shortcuts"

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much. You kids who think it won't happen to you? It will. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, the product works great. Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget. One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater. My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum. (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.) He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this. I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed. He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went. He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977 - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram. Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.","CG","OR","True","A21TPY9BVC9IKZ","B0006GVNOA","Eats Lint"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall. We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer. I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is! I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime! Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works. The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe. - CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube! - My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race. - I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw. - As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster. - The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue. NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside. - INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert.

"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product! Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.","CG","OR","True","AMY6O4Z9HINO0","B0006GVNOA","Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!! The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.","CG","OR","True","A3TMNU7VNK5JJE","B0006GVNOA","Does what it needs to"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","4.0","Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple. So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it. 1. Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this. 2. Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape. 3. Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go. 4. Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods). 5. Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning. I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house. 6. Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.","CG","OR","True","A1WD61B0C3KQZB","B0006GVNOA","Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","3.0","first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it. so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush... another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector. with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!","CG","OR","True","A25C30G90PKSQA","B0006GVNOA","good kit with some caveats"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle. I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.","CG","CG","True","A2B2JVUX5YN8RU","B0006GVNOA","Worked like a charm"
"Appliances_5.json.gz","5.0","Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures. My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent. That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit. This product is very easy to use. I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent. I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension. After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean. Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill. I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening. Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing. I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces. A little price to pay for a clean vent.","CG","CG","True","A1IT56MV1C09VS","B0006GVNOA","Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning"
